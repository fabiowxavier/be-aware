## Design Decisions

 ![WIREFRAME LAYOUT IMAGE"](assets/images/wireframe.png)

![COLOR-PALLET"](assets/images/pallet.png) ![COLOR-PALLET1"](assets/images/pallet-1.png) ![COLOR-PALLET2"](assets/images/pallet-2.png)


### Fonts

   #### Logo : Fredoka.   
   #### Primary font : Exo                  
   #### Secondary font : Sans-serif
  
  

### Accessibility Considerations

 #### Color Contrast:

- I use a color palette that provides adequate contrast between text and background elements, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments.


#### Alt Text for Images:

- I provide descriptive alt text for all images, accurately conveying their content to users with visual impairments and those using screen readers.


#### Additional Considerations:

- I use appropriate heading levels (h1, h2, h3, etc.) to structure the content, making it easier for users with screen readers to navigate.
- I ensure that all elements can be navigated and activated using a keyboard, without relying solely on a mouse.
- I provide clear focus indicators to help users understand which element is currently active.
- I use a responsive design to ensure that my applications are accessible on various devices, including mobile and tablets.
- I implement ARIA attributes to provide additional semantic information to assistive technologies.
- I used alt attributes to all buttons for a better user experience for visually impaired users.

Please not that some elements might not be used*



## AI Tools Usage

 - I used Gemini, a large language model, to assist me in writing this README. Gemini helped me generate ideas, improve the clarity and structure of the content, and ensure that the README is informative and engaging

During testing I found that in small screens when changed the orientation of the screen from portrait to landscape the form gets engulfed by the navbar and footer.

Please not that this problem still not fixed*

### Tools used for finding problems.

 #### Chrome DevTools

 During the project's structural development phase, I encountered various obstacles. Through the use of Chrome DevTools, I was able to effectively diagnose and rectify these problems.



## Deployment

### Deployment Process
The deployment process went smoothly overall, however, I did identify a small problem with the contacts.html form when viewed on mobile devices.


### Final Thoughts
At first, I was worried about this project, but as I worked on it, I got more comfortable. There were a few things that were tricky and took longer than I expected. Even though I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in the past four weeks, it took some time to really understand it all. But once I started building the website, I remembered more and was able to put it together.

## Code Attribution

**Bootstrap:**

This project uses Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework. 

**MDBootstrap:**

This project utilizes MDBootstrap, a Material Design framework for Bootstrap. 

**W3Schools:**

This project benefited from tutorials and examples found on W3Schools.

## Future Improvements

As the future improvements in this project, I aim to improve the form's responsiveness on mobile devices and potentially expand the website's content offerings. Additionally, incorporating a search engine would provide visitors with a more efficient way to find information.
