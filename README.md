- Wireframe and layout planned of a viewport on small screen and big screen 

### Fonts

   #### Logo : Fredoka.   
   #### Primary font : Exo                  
   #### Secondary font : Sans-serif
  
  

### Accessibility Considerations

 #### Color Contrast:

- I use a color palette that provides adequate contrast between text and background elements, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments.


#### Alt Text for Images:

- I provide descriptive alt text for all images, accurately conveying their content to users with visual impairments and those using screen readers.


#### Additional Considerations:

- I use appropriate heading levels (h1, h2, h3, etc.) to structure the content, making it easier for users with screen readers to navigate.
- I ensure that all elements can be navigated and activated using a keyboard, without relying solely on a mouse.
- I provide clear focus indicators to help users understand which element is currently active.
- I use a responsive design to ensure that my applications are accessible on various devices, including mobile and tablets.
- I implement ARIA attributes to provide additional semantic information to assistive technologies.
- I used alt attributes to all buttons for a better user experience for visually impaired users.

Please not that some elements might not be used*



## AI Tools Usage

 - I used Gemini, a large language model, to assist me in writing this README. Gemini helped me generate ideas, improve the clarity and structure of the content, and ensure that the README is informative and engaging
